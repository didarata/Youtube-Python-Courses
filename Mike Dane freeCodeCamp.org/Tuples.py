#Tuples is a type of data structure, container for different values. Tuples very similiar to a list.  Touple is created with ()

coordinates = [(4, 5), (6, 7), (80, 34), (134, 230)]    # You can add Touples inside lists
#coordinates[1] = 10        Tuple CANNOT BE MODIFIED IN ANYWAY, you cant add, cant change etc etc.
print(coordinates[0])
